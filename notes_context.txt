Here’s a detailed overview of your Parametric Articulatory Voice Synth (CrowCrow) project as it stands, focusing on the files that matter for the synth, UI, and audio signal path.
(Node.js configs and build files are omitted as requested.)

Project Structure & File Roles
public/index.html
Purpose:
The main HTML file for your app.
What it does:
Hosts the UI: Start/Stop button, phoneme buttons, parameter sliders, tract visualizer, oscilloscope, and parameter display.
Related to:
All UI event listeners and parameter updates in src/main.js.
public/audio/processors/
GlottisProcessor.js
Purpose:
AudioWorkletProcessor that simulates the glottis (vocal fold source).
What it does:
Receives parameters like frequency, tenseness, intensity, and loudness.
Generates a periodic glottal pulse and adds noise (via SimplexNoise).
Signal path:
Receives input from SubglottalProcessor, outputs to TransientProcessor.
SubglottalProcessor.js
Purpose:
AudioWorkletProcessor that simulates the subglottal system (lungs/breath).
What it does:
Receives parameters like breathCycleRate and effort.
Calculates and outputs intensity and loudness, which are sent to the main thread and then to GlottisProcessor.
Signal path:
First node in the chain; outputs to GlottisProcessor.
TransientProcessor.js
Purpose:
AudioWorkletProcessor for plosive bursts.
What it does:
Receives audio from GlottisProcessor.
When triggered, injects a short burst of noise (for plosives) before passing audio to the next stage.
Signal path:
Receives from GlottisProcessor, outputs to both TractProcessor and NasalProcessor.
TractProcessor.js
Purpose:
AudioWorkletProcessor that simulates the vocal tract as a series of segments.
What it does:
Each segment has a radius (controlled by zones).
Applies delay and damping to shape the sound.
Supports oral closure (for nasals/plosives) via the oralClosureZone parameter.
Signal path:
Receives from TransientProcessor, outputs to ChannelMergerNode (or gain).
NasalProcessor.js
Purpose:
AudioWorkletProcessor that simulates the nasal tract.
What it does:
Receives the same input as TractProcessor (from TransientProcessor).
Applies a simple formant filter (low-pass or resonator).
Has a nasalCoupling parameter to gate the signal (0 = closed velum, 1 = open).
Signal path:
Receives from TransientProcessor, outputs to ChannelMergerNode (or gain).
SimplexNoise.js
Purpose:
Utility for generating smooth noise.
What it does:
Used by GlottisProcessor for breath/noise components.
src/main.js
Purpose:
The main JavaScript entry point and controller.
What it does:
Creates and connects all audio nodes (subglottal, glottis, transient, tract, nasal, gain, master gain, analyser).
Handles UI event listeners for all sliders and buttons.
Sets parameters and syncs between UI and audio nodes.
Manages phoneme sequencing (via PhonemeSequencer).
Gating and animating the master gain for discrete phoneme playback.
Renders the parameter list and updates parameter displays.
Draws the tract visualizer and oscilloscope.
Handles synth start/stop logic and cleanup.
Signal path:
Orchestrates the entire audio signal chain and parameter flow.
src/audio/audio-utils.js
Purpose:
Utility functions for audio.
What it does:
Functions like fadeInGain and fadeOutGain for smooth volume transitions, and other reusable audio helpers.
src/audio/PhonemeSequencer.js
Purpose:
Class that manages triggering phonemes.
What it does:
Looks up phoneme parameters (including duration) from phonemeMap.js.

Parameter flow:
UI sliders set parameters for subglottal, glottis, and tract processors.
SubglottalProcessor calculates intensity/loudness and sends them to GlottisProcessor.
PhonemeSequencer can override parameters for one-shot phoneme playback, using gating on the master gain node for discrete output.
Nasal coupling and oral closure are set per-phoneme for nasals.

Key Points
Audio signal path is modular and extensible, with each processor in its own file.
main.js is the orchestrator, connecting everything and handling UI.
PhonemeMap and PhonemeSequencer allow for easy extension to new phonemes and features.
UI and visualization are handled in dedicated files for tract and oscilloscope.

 Here’s a revised, prioritized, and grouped to-do list for your articulatory synth project, focusing on coverage, realism, and incremental complexity.
Completed tasks (XXX) are omitted.

No problem — here’s the same list in a **copy-paste friendly format** with numbers as part of the text (no bullets or formatting symbols):

TODO LIST STARTS HERE :

---

E. Extend PhonemeSequencer and Diacritic Support 
27. Extend PhonemeSequencer to support sequencing from a string input.
28. Add a function `playFromText(input, spacing)` that accepts a space-separated string of phoneme symbols and a spacing value in seconds.
29. Add UI controls to allow users to enter a phoneme string and trigger `playFromText` (e.g., a text box and play button). XXX
30. Parse each token and extract diacritics from the phoneme symbol (e.g., "n̥" → base: "n", diacritics: ["̥"]).
31. Create a helper function `applyDiacritics(baseParams, diacriticList)` that modifies the base phoneme parameters using predefined mappings:
  a. "̥" → `voiced = 0`  
  b. "̃" → `nasalCoupling = 1`  
  c. "ʰ" → `aspirationLevel = 1`  
  d. "ː" → `duration *= 1.5`
32. For each parsed phoneme, look it up in `phonemeMap`, apply diacritic modifications using `applyDiacritics`, and schedule it using the existing playback mechanism.
33. Add spacing to the current phoneme's duration to determine the next start time; allow negative spacing for overlap.
34. Ensure Unicode normalization is used to handle combined diacritic input.

35\. Add nasal fricatives (optional) — For rare IPA nasal+fricative blends


F. Coarticulation & Expressivity
